# Naming conventions
## Test Files
- all test files should start with `test_`, and use snake case naming convention (i.e. `test_my_functionality.py`).

# Test Functions
- all test functions should start with `test_`, and use snake case naming convention.
```python
def test_my_functionality():
    # Test code here
    pass
```
## Test Classes
- all test classes should start with `Test`, and use CamelCase naming convention.
```python
class TestMyFunctionality:
    def test_my_functionality(self):
        # Test code here
        pass
```
