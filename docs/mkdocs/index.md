# VFN-RAG

RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) for Voice for Nature

## What is VFN-RAG?

VFN-RAG is a Retrieval-Augmented Generation system designed for the Voice for Nature project. It enables natural language querying over document collections with cited sources, making it ideal for research and information retrieval tasks.

## What is RAG?

**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a technique that combines:
- **Retrieval**: Searching through your document collection to find relevant information
- **Generation**: Using AI to synthesize answers based on the retrieved documents
- **Citation**: Providing source references for every answer

Instead of relying on general knowledge, RAG answers questions based on your specific documents, ensuring accuracy and traceability.

## Quick Start

Will be populated by the development team.
