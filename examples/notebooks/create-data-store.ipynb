Therefore, mottled ducks in Texas will\\nincreasingly depend upon wetland and associated\\nhabitats provided and protected by NWRs and Wildlife\\nManagement Areas (Stutzenbaker 1988).\\nThere is not currently an operational annual range-\\nwide survey of breeding mottled ducks as there are for\\nother North American waterfowl species. The only\\ncontinuous survey (since 1986) of breeding mottled\\nducks for the Western Gulf Coast Population is on NWRs\\nof the mid and upper Texas Gulf Coast. The Chenier Plain\\nNWR Complex (Complex) on the upper Texas Gulf Coast\\n(the region east of Houston, Texas, to the Louisiana\\nborder) historically accounted for .50% of the mottled\\nducks counted on Texas coastal NWRs (U.S. Fish and\\nWildlife Service [USFWS], unpublished data). Estimated\\nindicated breeding pairs, based on visually corrected\\naerial surveys on NWRs, have declined 94% since 1986\\ndespite a relatively large increase in the mid-1990s and\\nremained at relatively low levels throughout the 2000s\\n(Figure 1). Although these trends were documented on\\nNWRs of the upper Texas Gulf Coast, other indices reveal\\nrecent declines of varying magnitude for mottled ducks\\nthroughout Texas (GCJV 2007). Johnson (2009) conclud-\\ned that the trends represented by the breeding pair\\nsurvey on NWRs best corresponded with the trends of\\nestimated mottled duck population finite growth rate on\\nthe western Gulf Coast compared to other population\\nsurveys. Numerous hypotheses have been advanced as\\ncontributing to the observed decline in mottled ducks on\\nNWRs and in Texas (GCJV 2007). These include 1) loss or\\ndegradation of reproductive habitats (e.g., pair ponds,\\nsuitable nesting cover, and brood-rearing habitats), 2)\\nincreasing predator populations (Elsey et al. 2004), 3) loss\\nand degradation of nonbreeding habitats (i.e., winter,\\nmolt), 4) reduction of ecological disturbance (e.g., cattle\\nand goose grazing or prescribed burning), 5) redistribu-\\ntion of populations (i.e., from Texas to Louisiana), and 6)\\ncontinued exposure to lead from spent shot shells\\n(Merendino et al. 2005). Concern for the status and\\nfuture of mottled ducks has resulted in the USFWS\\ndeclaring the species a focal species in the Migratory Bird\\nProgram Focal Species Strategy (USFWS 2005).\\nTo attract mottled ducks for breeding and subsequent\\nrecruitment on NWRs, managers should provide pairing,\\nnesting, and brood-rearing habitats. During the early\\nportion of the breeding season through mid-incubation,\\nmost duck species are territorial with females selecting\\npair loafing areas in wetlands, usually referred to as pair\\nponds, with spacing influenced by food distribution,\\nlocation of nesting cover, and predator populations\\n(Anderson and Titman 1992). Pair ponds are defended as\\nterritories because they provide access to energy and\\nnutrition sources necessary for reproduction, ultimately\\ninfluencing potential recruitment (Stutzenbaker 1988;\\nAnderson and Titman 1992). Unfortunately, little is\\nknown about the habitat characteristics of ponds that\\nattract paired mottled ducks for breeding efforts, which\\nis information NWR managers need to increase recruit-\\nment of mottled ducks.\\nMottled ducks initiate breeding activities much earlier\\nthan other North American duck species because they\\nare nonmigratory and occupy southerly habitats. Paulus\\n(1988) reported that 90% of females were paired by\\nDecember and 100% paired by February with the peak of\\nnest initiation in Texas and Louisiana during March and\\nApril. Territorial defense typically starts in January, with\\nthe peak of three-bird flights (territorial resident males\\nchasing intruding pairs) occurring in March and April\\ncorresponding to the peak of the breeding season\\n(Paulus 1988; Stutzenbaker 1988). Moorman and Gray\\n(1994) indicated that mated pairs usually feed together\\nin defended pair ponds prior to and during egg laying\\nuntil pair bonds break during incubation. Spacing of\\npaired mottled ducks in territorial ponds indicates\\nforaging areas used by the pair during the breeding\\nseason (Paulus 1984), but rarely includes a nest site (Allen\\n1980; Baker 1983; Paulus 1984). Therefore, investigation\\nof defended pair ponds by mottled ducks allows for\\nevaluation of habitat characteristics that initially attract\\nbreeding pairs for reproductive activities.\\nFrom the perspective of a coastal marsh manager,\\nhabitat management for breeding mottled ducks may\\nconflict with habitat management for wintering water-\\nfowl. For example, managing for waterfowl preparing to\\nmigrate usually involves providing high-energy foods\\n(e.g., seeds and tubers) for large flocks, whereas\\nmanagement for breeding mottled ducks focuses on\\nprovision of invertebrates rich in protein and minerals\\nnecessary for reproduction in isolated areas that provide\\nnesting and brood-rearing habitat. In addition, common\\nvegetation management practices (e.g., livestock grazing\\nand prescribed fire) on NWRs may influence habitat use\\nby breeding mottled ducks. Thus, thorough knowledge\\nof waterfowl–habitat interactions within coastal marsh\\nhabitats is essential to the development of integrated\\nmanagement practices for all species. We investigated\\nthe use of pair ponds by breeding mottled ducks on the\\nChenier Plain NWR Complex on the upper Texas Gulf\\nCoast. Our objectives were to 1) determine the number\\nFigure 1.

The total acquired area of the\\nComplex was 42,762 ha; 56%, 32%, 8%, and 4% on\\nMcFaddin, Anahuac, Texas Point, and Moody NWRs,\\nrespectively (USFWS 2006). We did not sample pair\\nponds on Moody NWR for this stud because of poor\\naccess. Mottled ducks are considered a priority species in\\nthe Comprehensive Conservation Plan of the Complex\\n(USFWS 2006).\\nWe used 2002 aerial photography digitized in ArcMap\\n(Environmental Systems Research Institute, Redlands, CA)\\nand field measurements of salinity gradients during that\\nsame year to characterize availability of ponds in the\\ncoastal marsh. We recognize that salinity gradients may\\nhave shifted between 2002 and initiation of the study,\\nbut all field salinity measurements during the study\\ncorresponded to the initial 2002 classification of marsh\\ntype. To determine the number of ponds available for\\nbreeding mottled ducks, we used ArcMap to count all\\nopen water bodies (i.e., ponds) that were $9.29 m 2 in\\nthe four different coastal marsh types (fresh [0–0.5 parts\\nper thousand {ppt} salinity], intermediate [0.5–3.5 ppt],\\nbrackish [3.5–10 ppt], and saline [ .10 ppt]) on the\\nComplex. Bodies of water in prairies, ditches, canals,\\nbayous, and manmade ponds or reservoirs were\\nexcluded from this study except when water levels of\\ncanals or ditches exceeded banks enough to be 9.29 m 2\\nin area in adjacent coastal marsh. When a pond appeared\\nto be divided by vegetation, each division was marked as\\nan individual pond when sites were visually isolated\\n(vegetation was $1 m tall and at $75% of the separated\\nsurface area was bordered by vegetation). For large\\nmarsh areas of intermixed water and vegetation without\\nobvious borders, individual ponds were delineated based\\non visually defined isolated areas of open water. Because\\nthere were .18,000 marked as potentially available, we\\nmeasured the area of 425 randomly selected ponds\\nstratified by marsh type (2% of total ponds), calculated\\nthe average area by marsh type, and multiplied those\\naverages by the number of marked ponds per marsh\\ntype for each refuge to estimate total surface area of\\nidentified ponds.\\nOnce locations of all potential ponds were determined,\\nwe assigned a number to each pond with ArcMap, and\\nthen used a random number generator to randomly\\nchoose numbers and corresponding ponds stratified by\\nmarsh type and refuge. To estimate the percentage of\\navailable ponds breeding mottled ducks used, we\\nrandomly chose ponds in each marsh type to determine\\npond occupancy by pairs. Each randomly selected pond\\nwas visited once by airboat, truck, all-terrain vehicle, or\\nfoot from 3 March to 9 April 2004, and 25 February to 6\\nApril 2005, from sunrise to 3 h after sunrise or from 3 h\\nbefore sunset to sunset to determine the presence or\\nabsence of a breeding mottled duck pair. These dates\\nand time periods correspond to presence of feeding by\\npairs in selected territorial pair or loafing ponds (Paulus\\n1984; Stutzenbaker 1988). We used the area of each\\nmarsh type on each refuge to stratify pond sampling\\nacross marsh types and individual refuges. Our objective\\nwas to sample 100 fresh, 150 intermediate, 125 brackish,\\nand 100 saline marsh potential pair ponds for occupancy\\nacross the entire Complex each year of the study (2004,\\n2005). We downloaded coordinates of each randomly\\nselected pond (ponds were randomly selected each year)\\ninto a Global Positioning System (Garmin 76S7), which\\nwe used to locate each pond (accuracy 6 3 m) in the\\nfield.\\nIf mottled ducks were flushed from a randomly\\nselected pond, we recorded whether it was a pair or a\\nlone bird. We never flushed greater than two birds from\\na selected pond. When an indicated breeding pair (pair\\nor lone male) was recorded on a random pond, the pond\\nwas designated as a ‘‘random/used’’ pond, and if no\\nbirds were present, the pond was designated as\\n‘‘random/unused.’’ If a marked pond no longer existed\\n(i.e., was overgrown with cattail Typha spp., dried up,\\netc.), we randomly selected another pond from those\\navailable within the proper stratification.\\nAt each randomly selected pond, we measured water\\nsalinity, water depth, and pond area; evaluated height of\\nsurrounding vegetation; estimated the percent coverage\\nof emergent vegetation; and determined the presence or\\nabsence of submergent plant communities to character-\\nize general habitats the ponds provided. The presence of\\nrecently (within previous 3 mo) burned or grazed\\nvegetation surrounding each pond was also recorded\\nand verified with prescribed-fire or cattle-grazing re-\\ncords. Vegetation structure surrounding the pond was\\ncategorized by estimating the height of the dominant\\nvegetation. Categories of surrounding vegetation were\\n‘‘short’’ (,0.6 m; e.g., Paspalum vaginatum , Distichlis\\nspicata, and Sagittaria spp.), ‘‘medium’’ (0.6–1.3 m; e.g.,\\nSpartina patens , Schoenoplectus americanus , and Schoe-\\nnoplectus robustus ), and ‘‘tall’’ (.1.3 m; e.g., Typha spp.,\\nPhragmites australis , and Schoenoplectus californicus ).\\nWe measured salinity by submersing a salinity meter\\n(YSI, Models 30 and 63) to the bottom of the pond in\\nundisturbed areas and recording two to three readings\\n(ppt) in different areas of each pond. If there was a\\ndifference .1.0 ppt among readings, we noted the high,\\nlow, and average values. Otherwise, we only recorded\\nthe average. We measured water depth (mm) at three\\nrandom locations with a meter stick. The stick was held\\nvertically in the water and allowed to fall to the bottom\\nof the pond using its own weight. If there was a\\ndifference .100 mm in the depth readings, we recorded\\nthe high, low, and average measurements. To estimate\\nthe surface area for small ponds ( ,30 m 2), we used a\\nmeter stick or tape measure to physically measure pond\\nperimeter and then surface area was calculated; for\\nmedium-sized ponds (30–2,000 m 2), the pond edge was\\nMottled Duck Pair Ponds D.

Finally, we assessed the influence\\nof cattle grazing and prescribed fire disturbances on the\\nproportion of ponds used associated with these events\\nversus the proportion for all available ponds.\\nWe used a 2-way factorial analysis of variance (ANOVA)\\nto compare measured habitat features of pond area (ha),\\nwater depth (mm), water salinity (ppt), and pond\\ncoverage by emergent vegetation (%) between used\\nand unused ponds and marsh type (fresh, intermediate,\\nbrackish, and saline). Following a significant ( P , 0.05)\\nANOVA, a least significant difference test was used to\\ncompare means among marsh types.\\nResults\\nIn 2002, the total area of coastal marsh on the Chenier\\nPlain NWR Complex was estimated to be 35,738 ha\\n(Table 1). Intermediate marsh represented the highest\\npercentage of marsh type available on the Complex,\\nfollowed by brackish, fresh, and saline. Of the total marsh\\narea, we sampled 22,454 ha for pair ponds, which\\nrepresented 63% of the total marsh available on the\\nComplex (Table 1). The sampled area excluded inacces-\\nsible areas of intermediate and fresh marsh of McFaddin\\nNWR and portions of saline and brackish marsh of Texas\\nPoint NWR. Sampled marsh area was representative of\\nthe entire Complex; intermediate marsh represented the\\nhighest percentage (74%), followed by brackish (18%),\\nfresh (4%) and saline (3%; Table 1).\\nWe identified 18,830 ponds in the sampled area of the\\nfour marsh types on the Complex; the area of these\\nponds constituted 7.4% of the available sampled marsh\\narea on the Complex (Table 2). Anahuac NWR had the\\ngreatest number of ponds in fresh, brackish, and saline\\nmarsh types, whereas McFaddin NWR had the greatest\\nnumber of ponds in the intermediate marsh type.\\nOverall, McFaddin NWR had the greatest number of\\nidentified ponds by a small margin (Table 2). Ranking, by\\nmarsh type, of pond numbers and area was intermediate,\\nbrackish, saline, and fresh (Table 2). Average (SE) pond\\nsize, by marsh type, was 0.03 (0.01) ha in fresh marsh,\\n0.13 (0.06) ha in intermediate, 0.06 (0.02) ha in brackish,\\nand 0.06 (0.03) ha in saline.

There was no difference in\\naverage water salinity between used and unused ponds\\n(F1,812 = .011, P = 0.74; Table 6).\\nDiscussion\\nAlthough recognized as an important part of the\\nreproductive activity of waterfowl (Anderson and Titman\\n1992) there have been few descriptions of habitats used\\nby paired mottled ducks during the nesting season\\ncompared to most other species of ducks. Stutzenbaker\\n(1988) reported that male mottled ducks defended ponds\\nformed by temporary open water sites in prairie habitats,\\nespecially those surrounded by sienna bean Sesbania\\ndrummondii. However, these sites have become relatively\\nrare since the 1980s. Durham and Afton (2006) concluded\\nthat flooded rice fields were important loafing and\\nfeeding habitat for mottled ducks nesting in agricultural\\nlands of former coastal prairie in Louisiana, especially\\nduring drought. White and James (1978) reported that\\nmottled duck foraging habitat was typically ,30 cm in\\ndepth. Weeks (1969) reported that estimated loafing area\\nsize ranged from 10 to 130 ha, but was usually ,40 ha.\\nHowever, there are no detailed descriptions of habitats\\nused by paired mottled ducks in coastal marsh habitats.\\nThe sheer number of potentially available ponds and\\nlow occupancy rate (e.g., 0.8 ponds/ha and 1.9%,\\nrespectively, on the Chenier Plain NWR Complex) likely\\nleads to an assumption that these habitats are not\\nlimiting to mottled duck populations in coastal marsh.\\nSuch an assumption may hinder management for\\nbreeding mottled ducks because it is quite apparent\\nthat certain features of ponds attract paired mottled\\nducks. Therefore, managers should include consideration\\nof pair habitats, in addition to nesting and brood-rearing\\nhabitats, in management plans for breeding mottled\\nducks in coastal marsh.\\nTable 4.

Considering the relatively low availability\\nof freshwater marsh on the Complex, such definitive\\nselection ratios indicate that it is critical to concentrate\\nmanagement efforts for breeding mottled ducks on\\nfreshwater marsh.\\nThe relatively smaller selection ratio of saline marsh\\nwas due to inclusion of Texas Point NWR, where saline\\nmarsh was the predominant marsh type. Excluding Texas\\nPoint NWR data, the freshwater : saline marsh type\\nselection ratio increased to 4.6. Use of saline habitats by\\nbreeding mottled ducks appears to be more than\\nexpected considering the perceived negative factors\\nassociated with breeding attempts in these habitats (e.g.,\\nMoorman et al. 1991). However, breeding pairs of\\nmottled ducks are frequently observed feeding in saline\\nmarsh habitats, especially those habitats dominated by\\nRuppia maritima . On the Chenier Plain NWR Complex,\\nsaline marsh is frequently separated from adjacent\\nintermediate marsh by salt prairie ridges, facilitating\\neasy movements among habitat types (P. Walther and M.\\nWhitbeck, USFWS, personal observation). Further evalu-\\nation is needed to determine resources provided by\\nsaline marsh habitats for breeding mottled ducks and\\nwhether females preferentially move to areas of fresher\\nmarsh for nesting.\\nStructure of the vegetation community surrounding\\nponds had a greater influence on pond use than the\\npresence of submergent and emergent vegetation.\\nMottled duck pairs selected for ponds that were\\nsurrounded by relatively short vegetation ( ,0.6m) and\\nhabitats influenced by livestock grazing. These condi-\\ntions are complementary, with 60% of all ponds with\\nshort surrounding vegetation being grazed, whereas\\n28% of the ponds that were not being grazed were\\nrepresented by short surrounding vegetation. For used\\nponds only, 73% of grazed ponds had short surrounding\\nvegetation.\\nDisturbance by grazing herbivores is a natural\\ncomponent of the coastal marsh ecosystem (Bhattachar-\\njee et al. 2007). Management of the Chenier Plain NWR\\nComplex includes prescribed burning, cattle grazing, and\\nincreasing opportunity for grazing by snow geese Chen\\ncaerulescens to replicate historical natural disturbance\\n(USFWS 2006). Moderate grazing following burns in\\nmarshes also prolongs the availability of new grass\\nshoots, a valuable food for snow geese (Gosselink et al.\\n1979). The current cattle-grazing management program\\nis quite flexible to take advantage of varying quantity\\nand quality of forage, availability of fresh groundwater to\\nprovide watering sites within all marsh types, and unit-\\nspecific management objectives (USFWS 2006). Grazing\\npressure and timing is used to create conditions that\\nallow for the germination, growth, and reproduction of\\nspecies adapted to frequent disturbance (i.e., early\\nsuccessional sere) by alternation of species composition\\nof plant communities (Valentine 1961; USFWS 2006).\\nMottled duck pair avoidance of recently burned but not\\ngrazed areas indicates that pond selection includes factors\\nin addition to the structure of surrounding vegetation\\nbecause the distribution of height of surrounding\\nvegetation was similar between burned and grazed ponds\\n(short grazed = 59.9% burned = 63.8%; medium grazed =\\n34.3% burned = 31.2%; tall grazed = 5.8% burned =\\n5.0%). Apparently, the physical disturbance from cattle\\ngrazing is creating additional conditions that attract paired\\nmottled ducks. Comparisons of invertebrate populations\\nbetween grazed and burned ponds may provide insight\\ninto the attractiveness of grazing-disturbed habitats to\\npaired mottled ducks.\\nIt is unlikely that pair-pond habitats would be used by\\nfemale mottled ducks for brood rearing (Rigby 2008) or\\nby birds during molt (Stutzenbaker 1988). Therefore, it is\\nrecommended for managers of coastal marsh to provide\\ndifferent habitats to attract and sustain breeding mottled\\nducks. However, mottled duck broods have greater\\nsurvival in fresh compared to saline conditions, so\\nmanagement of breeding mottled ducks should concen-\\ntrate on fresh marsh (Moorman et al. 1991). Use of\\nvegetation disturbance, especially cattle grazing, is useful\\nfor management of mottled ducks in coastal marsh.\\nFurther, prescribed fire can be used to focus and\\ndistribute cattle grazing within fresher areas of coastal\\nmarsh to create pair-pond habitats attractive to mottled\\nducks. Grazing management is also used to create\\nnesting cover desired by mottled ducks on the Chenier\\nPlain NWR Complex (USFWS 2006). Our results indicate\\ndevelopment of adaptive grazing management plans in\\nfresh and intermediate coastal marsh will be beneficial to\\nbreeding mottled ducks.\\nTable 6.
