This is a list of the bird species recorded in the Netherlands. The avifauna of the Netherlands included a total of 564 species documented in the wild through October 2022 according to Checklist of Dutch Bird Species with supplemental additions from Avibase. The checklist "incorporates all decisions by the Dutch rarities committee 'Commissie Dwaalgasten Nederlandse Avifauna' (CDNA) and the Dutch taxonomic committee 'Commissie Systematiek Nederlandse Avifauna' (CSNA)". Of these species, 13 have been introduced by humans, and one is extinct. Two species were inadequately documented before 1800.[1]

This list's taxonomic treatment (designation and sequence of orders, families and species) and nomenclature (English and scientific names) are those of The Clements Checklist of Birds of the World, 2022 edition.[2]

The following tags have been used to highlight some categories of occurrence. The notes of population status such as "endangered" apply to the world population and are from Bird Checklists of the World.[3]

(A) Accidental - a species that rarely or accidentally occurs in the Netherlands, requiring review by the CDNA for inclusion in the record
(I) Introduced - a species whose "ancestors originated from captivity or ship transport" and which have been established for at least 20 years per the CDNA
(B) Before 1800 - species "recorded only before 1800 (location and/or date not well enough documented)" per the CDNA
