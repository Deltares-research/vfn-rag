Smelt (Osmerus eperlanus) – Found in estuaries and coastal areas, with some populations moving to freshwater to spawn.
Shad (Alosa alosa and Alosa fallax) – Once abundant, now rarer, migrates into rivers to spawn.
These species thrive in the diverse aquatic environments of the Netherlands, from the North Sea coast to its extensive river systems and inland lakes. Many species, like herring and cod, are also central to Dutch fishing industries.

Fishing in the Netherlands has deep historical, cultural, and economic significance. With its extensive coastline along the North Sea, numerous rivers, lakes, and canals, the country offers a variety of fishing opportunities, both for commercial and recreational purposes. Here’s a detailed overview of fishing in the Netherlands:

1. Commercial Fishing
Commercial fishing in the Netherlands is an important industry, particularly in the coastal waters of the North Sea. Dutch fishing fleets are among the largest in Europe, and they primarily target saltwater species such as herring, mackerel, cod, plaice, and sole.

Key Aspects of Commercial Fishing:
North Sea Fisheries: The North Sea is one of the most productive fishing grounds in Europe. Dutch fleets target pelagic fish (like herring and mackerel), demersal fish (like cod, plaice, and sole), and shellfish (like shrimp and mussels).

Dutch Ports: Major fishing ports include IJmuiden, Scheveningen, Den Helder, and Urk. Urk, in particular, has a long-standing tradition as a fishing town and remains a key hub for the fishing industry.

Fish Auctions: The Netherlands has an extensive fish auction network, where fish are sold daily to domestic and international buyers. Auctions take place in various ports, with IJmuiden and Urk being among the busiest.

Sustainable Practices: The Dutch fishing industry has increasingly focused on sustainable practices. Many fishers follow quotas and conservation rules established by the European Union’s Common Fisheries Policy (CFP). Techniques like pulse fishing (an electrical method to catch fish) were used until recently but are now banned by the EU.

Aquaculture: In addition to traditional fishing, aquaculture plays a growing role in the Dutch seafood industry. Fish farms produce species like mussels, oysters, and eel. The Dutch province of Zeeland is a key area for shellfish farming.

2. Recreational Fishing
Recreational fishing, or "sportvissen," is a popular activity in the Netherlands, with around two million anglers participating annually. It includes both freshwater and saltwater fishing, with a focus on sustainable fishing practices and catch-and-release.

Key Aspects of Recreational Fishing:
Freshwater Fishing: The Netherlands has an extensive network of rivers, lakes, and canals where anglers can fish for species such as carp, pike, perch, zander, and roach. Popular freshwater fishing areas include the IJsselmeer, the river systems of the Rhine, Meuse, and Waal, as well as smaller lakes and ponds.

Saltwater Fishing: Coastal and sea fishing is also widespread, with popular spots along the North Sea coast. Anglers often fish for sea bass, mackerel, flounder, and cod from the shore or boats.

Fishing License ("Vispas"): To fish legally in the Netherlands, a "Vispas" is required. This permit can be obtained through fishing associations or online. The Vispas covers most public fishing waters and allows anglers to fish in freshwater and some saltwater areas.

Fishing Associations: The Netherlands has many fishing clubs and associations, most notably Sportvisserij Nederland, the national organization for anglers. They oversee permits, manage fisheries, and promote sustainable fishing practices.

Catch-and-Release: Many Dutch anglers practice catch-and-release to protect fish populations. This is particularly encouraged for predatory species like pike and zander.

3. Fishing Tourism
Fishing tourism is an expanding niche in the Netherlands. With its abundance of fishing spots and the scenic beauty of its waters, the country attracts international anglers. Fishing holidays, particularly for carp, pike, and zander, are popular, especially in areas like:

IJsselmeer: A large freshwater lake in the heart of the Netherlands, known for its rich fish stocks, especially perch, pike, and zander.
Friesland: A northern province famous for its lakes, canals, and picturesque waterways, offering excellent freshwater fishing.
Zeeland: A southwestern province with numerous coastal fishing spots, including saltwater options and access to the North Sea.
4. Environmental and Sustainability Initiatives
The Netherlands is a leader in sustainable fisheries management. The country’s efforts include:

Marine Stewardship Council (MSC) Certification: Many Dutch fisheries are MSC certified, which means they adhere to sustainable fishing practices to prevent overfishing and protect marine ecosystems.

Fisheries Research: Dutch research institutions, like Wageningen University & Research, conduct studies on fish populations, sustainable fishing methods, and ecosystem management.

Common Fisheries Policy (CFP): As part of the European Union, the Netherlands follows the CFP, which sets quotas for fishing, promotes sustainable fishing practices, and aims to preserve fish stocks in European waters.

5. Popular Fish Species for Anglers
Some of the most sought-after fish species by Dutch anglers include:

Carp: Carp fishing is very popular, particularly in lakes and ponds. Carp fishing often involves special techniques and baits.
Pike: Predatory fish like pike are prized for their size and challenge. Many Dutch anglers pursue pike in lakes, rivers, and canals.
Zander: Zander is another popular species among sport fishers. It’s found in many Dutch waters and is known for its strong fight.
Perch: A smaller but common fish in many Dutch waters, perch is a favorite for both novice and experienced anglers.
6. Fishing Regulations
The Netherlands has strict fishing regulations to maintain healthy fish populations and ecosystems:

Closed Seasons: Certain fish species have closed seasons to protect spawning periods. For example, fishing for pike is often restricted during spring.
Size Limits: Minimum size limits are enforced to protect young fish. Anglers must return undersized fish to the water.
Protected Species: Some species, like European sturgeon, are protected, and fishing for them is illegal.
7. Traditional Fishing and Cultural Significance
Fishing has a deep cultural connection in the Netherlands. Traditional fishing communities, such as those in the former Zuiderzee (now IJsselmeer) region, have centuries-old practices. Towns like Volendam, Marken, and Urk have rich fishing histories that remain integral to their identities today.

The Dutch also celebrate fish in their cuisine, with dishes like "haring" (raw herring) being a national favorite, and seafood remains a key part of the culinary culture.
